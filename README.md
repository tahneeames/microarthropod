Analysis of richness, abundance, diversity and community assemblages of microarthropods in epiphytic bryophytes and lichens 

3x2 factorial experimental design
epiphyte type x treatment type 

[skirt bryophyte/bole bryophyte/lichen]
[corridor reserve/shelterwood] 


Accumunlation curves for each epiphyte 
T-Test for temperature differences between sites 
Kruskal-Wallis ranked sums for dry weight by species by treatment 
Violin plots for dry weights 

Two-way ANOVA for richness, abundance, and Shannon-Weiner diversity, paired with Tukey HSD   
PERMANOVA and PERMDISP testing betadiversity by treatment x epiphyte type 
Indicator species analyses by Factor, treatment, and epiphyte type 
Nestedness and Turnover calculation between sites (trmtxsubstrate factors)

Boxplot for richness, abundance, and diversity of epiphytes within treatment variables

NMDS for treatment, epiphyte, and treatment x epiphyte
