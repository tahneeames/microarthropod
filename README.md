Includes richness and abundance calculations based on raw taxon data and site metadata
Also includes shannon diversity for each site 

paired t-tests by treatment type, PERMANOVA, and Kruskal-Wallis multiple comparison test 

Boxplot for richness, abundance, and diversity of epiphytes within treatment variables, augmented with dot plots to show species of epiphytes within epiphyte type (mosses & lichens)
